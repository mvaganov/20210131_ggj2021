textA	"I hate them for what they did. I've been betrayed. The injustice of it all! They will never be forgiven!"
textB	"Finally! Look at how they suffer! Yes ... they suffer. Is it enough? ... Is this justice yet?"
textC	"Yes, bringing them more pain is delightful. I hate them. They are so wrong... they're causing me so much pain..."
textD	"So much bitterness. The pain they caused is long past, why do I seek more harm? Who's pain am I still feeling?"
textE	"I forgave them. I let them go, in my mind, in my heart. They were never my prisoners to set free. Losing this hatred I have only freed myself. I given up my search for death, and I'm seeking life."
